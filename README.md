# CannabisAutomatico
Mobile application for the automation and optimization of the production of medicinal cannabis in the greenhouse.
An application designed to automate resources for the production of cannabis in the greenhouse where the system, based on the stages of development of medicinal cannabis, adapts the conditions of the greenhouse according to the stage of the cultivation.

For this development we use resources such as:
Android studio: kotlin
Mysql databases
Arduino id
Hardware components for the operation of the system such as sensors, and Wi-Fi modules for connecting the systems
Php
To go

Medical cannabis is currently an economic boom for everything that this product solves, such as different diseases such as Parkinson's.
Currently in Colombia there is 44% of medical cannabis exports worldwide.
And it can become number 1, because its production per gram of this product is much lower compared to other powerful countries.
It is important for the cannabis industry since as the system works automatically, the cultivation can be adapted to the medicinal conditions required.
